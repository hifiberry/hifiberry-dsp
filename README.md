# HiFiberry DSP

Software for HiFiBerry boards equipped with DSP. This package can be 
used to read/write data to HiFiBerry DSP boards using the Beocreate TCP 
server.

The software comes "as-is". There is no individual support for this software. Feel free to post in the [HiFiBerry forum](https://support.hifiberry.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000377385-DSP-boards-and-Beocreate) for questions. 

## Installation

Before installing the dsptoolkit, you need to have a working Python 3
installation (>=3.10) and a working pip. You also need to enable SPI as
dsptoolkit needs SPI to communicate with the DSP.
Check out 
https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/08/enabling-the-spi-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/

You can then install the toolkit by just running
```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-dsp/master/install-dsptoolkit)
```

## sigmatcpserver

This server runs in background and provides a TCP interface (port 8089) 
to access DSP functions. It is compatible with SigmaStudio. That means 
you can directly deploy DSP programs from SigmaStudio and change 
parameters online.

## Command line utility

The dsptoolkit command is the main command line tool to communicate 
with the DSP TCP server. The command line parameters are documented
in [doc/dsptoolkit.md](doc/dsptoolkit.md)


## REW integration

The software can be used to push filters created by Room Equalisation 
Wizard (REW) to the DSP.
Have a look at the guide in[doc/rew-basic.md](doc/rew-basics.md)

## DSP profile format

DSP profiles can be generated directly in SigmaStudio. However, to 
enable the full potential of DSP Profiles and allow DSPToolkit to 
directly control the DSP program, you need to add some additional 
metadata to the XML file.
The process to create a DSP profile is documented in [doc/dspprofiles.md](/doc/dspprofiles.md)
